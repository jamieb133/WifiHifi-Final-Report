\section{System Design Overview}
\subsection{Microprocessor Platform}
The streaming capabilities and digital signal processing requirements of the system necessitated the choice of an appropriate microprocessor platform. 
A purely embedded solution was initially considered due to the availability of networking stacks such as FreeRTOS+UDP/IP and Light Weight IP (LWIP), the latter of which is available for ARM mbed platforms. This however would have limited audio and networking related software options that are available for general purpose operating systems such as Linux or QNX.

\medskip
As this was the first prototype for the project, the decision was made to select a Linux based platform as this would allow flexibility in the use of audio and streaming tools that are available for the OS. Benchmarking was conducted for potential platforms that would meet the system performance requirements as outlined in chapter 1, they are outlined in table \ref{table:HWPlatforms}.

\medskip
With a single core Broadcom BCM2835 1GHz CPU, 500MB of RAM and no option to implement an eMMC over an SD card, the Raspberry Pi Zero W is significantly under-powered when compared to the other platforms. 
However, the much reduced cost of the device at approximately £9.00\cite{RpiPrice} is significantly less expensive than its counterparts. The very small size of the board, 65x30mm, was also desirable as it would take up much less space on the master PCB housed within the rear enclosure of the cabinet. 
The wiringPi library is also compatible with the Raspberry Pi Zero W (RPZW) which would be convenient when interfacing with hardware peripherals such as the DAC, power-amplifier and user controls. The inclusion of a built in WLAN transceiver is particularly advantageous as this removes the need for a separate WLAN module/IC. 

\medskip
After careful consideration, this platform was selected due to the reasons outlined above. 
The chosen Linux distribution was Debian as it is the standard OS for the raspberry pi and allows easier configuration for real-time audio than other popular distributions such as Ubuntu. 
After the project was completed, further testing was carried out using the Odroid C0 in an attempt to gauge how the increased performance of the platform over the Raspberry Pi affected the performance of the overall system. 

\subsection{Audio Streaming Platform}
Several streaming platforms and tools were benchmarked with regards to requirements as outlined in chapter 1. 
With many options under Linux, two potential approaches to implementing streaming were derived. 
A raw streaming protocol could be implemented at a low level or, a sound server with necessary streaming capabilities and a suitable C++ API could be used in order to distribute multiple streams to different speakers.

\subsection{Signal Processing}
In order to reduce electronic component count, DSP has been used to implement signal processing tasks that would typically be achieved using analogue circuitry.
These include the crossover filters, frequency correction circuitry and tone controls.
\subsubsection{Crossover Filters}
A two-way crossover circuit is typically used to split the high and low frequencies between the tweeter and woofer respectively around a common crossover frequency using highpass and lowpass filters;
the specific value of this crossover frequency is chosen based on the frequency response of each driver.
As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:tweeter-response}, the resonant frequencies of the tweeter is approximately 1.5kHz.
The crossover frequency was initially set at 3kHz, an octave above the tweeter's resonant frequency.
After some trial and error, it was decided that a crossover frequency of 2.5kHz resulted in the most pleasant response, this is obviously subjective however implementing the filters in software allows them to be varied easily.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./figs/tweeter-response.pdf}

    \label{fig:woofer-response}
\end{figure}

Each crossover filter was implemented using an FIR filter with 75 coefficients. 
A class (\lstinline{FIRFilter}) was written that calculates the coefficients and performs sample by sample filtering of an input audio sample. 
The filter implementation utilises a real-time FIR filter library written by Bernd Porr (\lstinline{fir1}), the calculated coefficients are referenced by an instantiated \lstinline{fir1} object that performs the convolution algorithm. 

\medskip
On object construction, the class will numerically calculate the filter impulse response for the specified filter type and number of coefficents/taps. 
The impulse responses are calculated using the following equations\cite{DSP-berndporr}, where $h(n)$, $n$ and $\omega _c$ represent the filter impulse response, current sample and angular cutoff frequency ($\omega _c = 2\pi f_c$) respectively.

\begin{equation}
    h_{lowpass}(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\omega _c}{\pi}     &\text{for \(n=0\)}  \\
        \frac{1}{\pi n}sin(\omega _cn)    &\text{else}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    h_{highpass}(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        1-\frac{\omega _c}{\pi}     &\text{for \(n=0\)}  \\
        -\frac{1}{\pi n}sin(\omega _cn)    &\text{else}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\medskip
The impulse response is then windowed with a Blackman window.
This was chosen due to its greater attenuation in the stop band than a Hamming window\cite{DSP-berndporr}.
It was calculated using the following equation.

\begin{equation}
    \omega (n)=
    0.42 + 0.5cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{M}\right) + 0.08cos\left(\frac{4\pi n}{M}\right)
\end{equation}

Figures \ref{fig:tweeter-fft} and \ref{fig:woofer-fft} show plots of FFTs recorded for the highpass and lowpass filters respectively.
They were obtained by probing the relevant DAC output line and passing Gaussian white noise through the WifiHifi client, all other software filtering was disabled.
