Recent advances in wireless networking and consumer technology have led to the rise of the 'smart' speaker, incorporating digital assistants into the home. While now focussed on user-interaction, the root of this technology is in the home wireless speakers that preceeded them, most notably those pioneered by Sonos. While affordable for the average consumer, the use case of these speakers leads them to be spread throughout the home and isolated. Although other systems exist that contradict this and leverage the home WiFi network to provide stereo or surround sound, their price tags restrict their use to only the high-end consumer. This project has aimed to produce an affordable and open-source multi-channel speaker system which utilises WiFi communication and highlight the barriers to such a task. %%%CONCLUSIONS TO ADD
